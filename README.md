  ## Installation
  The project was built using node.js, so you will need that installed on your computer as a prerequisite. Clone the repo from GitHub to your workstation, then open a terminal window. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo to and from the terminal run "node index.js".

  ## Usage
  When run, the application will ask you a series of qeustions regarding the project you are creating the README for. All of the questions require a response to be entered, though the contribution section will default to the Contributors Covenant guidelines if you do not wish to provide a custom written guideline. Once all of the questions are answered, the README file will be created in the ./dist directory and from there can be moved to your project. If the ./dist directory does not exist, the app will create it the first time it is run. If the app encounters an error, it will be logged to the console window.
